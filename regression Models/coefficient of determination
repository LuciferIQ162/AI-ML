# Coefficient of Determination (R²): Key Points & Visual Guide

## 📌 Summary

- **R²** (coefficient of determination) measures how well a statistical model explains the variation in the **dependent variable** using **independent variable(s)**.

## 🎯 Range

- **0**: No variance explained  
- **1**: All variance explained  
- Values between 0 and 1: Partial explanatory power

## 🧠 Interpretation

- **R² = 0.25** means **25% of the variance** in the dependent variable is explained by the model.

## 📐 Formula

R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)


- **SS_res**: Sum of squared residuals (unexplained variance)  
- **SS_tot**: Total sum of squares (total variance)

In simple linear regression, R² = (correlation coefficient)².

## ✅ Properties

- Higher R² → Better fit
- Does **not imply causation**

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Can be negative** for poor models.
- R² **increases with more predictors**, even if irrelevant. Use **Adjusted R²** for multiple regression.

## 📊 Visual Interpretation of R² Values

The table below shows how much variance is explained by different R² values:

| R² Value | % Variance Explained | Interpretation                |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| 0.00     | 0%                   | No explanatory power          |
| 0.25     | 25%                  | Weak model                    |
| 0.50     | 50%                  | Moderate explanatory power    |
| 0.75     | 75%                  | Strong model                  |
| 1.00     | 100%                 | Perfect fit                   |

### 📌 Key Takeaway:

**R² quantifies the proportion of variation in the dependent variable explained by your model.**  
- **Range:** 0 (no fit) to 1 (perfect fit)
- **Use Adjusted R²** to avoid misleading results in multiple regression.
